# Cart project

This repo contains fixes and additional features for the can driver v2. This branch is mainly used for testing the `Sensor Controller Board V1.0` and the CAN communication. I will add some feedback for the next iteration of the PCB. 


## TODOS:
- Test the custom PCB and the MCP2515 module for CAN communication between two MCUs. 
- Add wake up from sleep mode feature, for minimal power consumtion.
- Fix the filter and listen on certain ID logic, cleaning up current.
